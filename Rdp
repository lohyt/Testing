You're absolutely right to be concerned — the setup you've described introduces multiple risk vectors that are commonly exploited. As your cybersecurity advisor, here’s a breakdown of the key risks and recommendations:

Risk Analysis:
VPN to RDP Architecture Risks:

Credential Exposure: If MFA isn't enforced, credentials could be phished and reused.

Lateral Movement: Once on an RDP session, attackers can move laterally within the internal network if segmentation and EDR are weak.

RDP Vulnerabilities: RDP services have historically been targeted with exploits (e.g., BlueKeep) and brute-force attacks.

Unmonitored Endpoints: If employees are using personal or poorly managed WFH devices, malware or keyloggers could compromise the RDP sessions.

Endpoint Control and Hygiene:

Many home systems are outside corporate endpoint detection and patch management.

Devices might not be running approved security configurations.

VPN Configuration Risks:

Split Tunneling: If enabled, it allows dual connectivity — potentially exposing internal assets to the internet.

Flat VPN Access: Employees might have broad access once connected, increasing the blast radius of any compromise.

Recommendations:
Harden RDP Access:

Enforce MFA for all RDP sessions.

Use gateway services like RD Gateway or Azure Bastion for secure access.

Monitor and restrict RDP session durations and idle timeouts.

Zero Trust Architecture:

Instead of VPN + RDP, consider identity-aware proxies or remote access through solutions like BeyondCorp, ZScaler Private Access, or Tailscale.

Access should be based on verified identity, posture of device, and real-time risk scoring.

Endpoint Management:

Ensure all endpoints (including WFH devices) are managed, encrypted, and have active EDR/XDR agents.

Block or isolate unmanaged devices at the VPN gateway.

Network Segmentation:

Restrict VPN access to only necessary systems (least privilege).

Use microsegmentation to prevent lateral movement inside the network.

Monitoring and Logging:

Monitor VPN logs, RDP logs, and correlate with endpoint data for anomalies.

Set alerts for brute-force attempts, geographic anomalies, or anomalous RDP activity.

This setup isn't inherently insecure, but it requires mature security controls to be safely used. In your report or discussion with the client, you should frame this as a high-risk architecture that requires compensating controls to remain acceptable.

Would you like help drafting a formal finding for this risk to include in your pentest report?

Thanks for that. Don't you think golden ticket and silver tickets attacks would be possible while using RDP 
ChatGPT said:
Yes — absolutely. The use of RDP in this context significantly increases the attack surface for Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, and related Kerberos-based attacks, especially if the environment isn't tightly locked down. Here's how:

Why RDP Increases Risk of Kerberos Ticket Attacks:
Credential Exposure in Memory:

When users RDP into systems, their Kerberos TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) are cached in memory (especially on older OS versions or if protections like Credential Guard aren’t enabled).

Tools like Mimikatz can dump TGTs, TGS tickets (for Silver Tickets), or even NTLM hashes directly from LSASS memory.

Privilege Escalation Pathways:

If an RDP-connected user is a domain admin or has high privileges, an attacker gaining access to that session can steal a TGT and forge a Golden Ticket.

Even regular users accessing critical services can lead to Silver Ticket attacks by forging service tickets (TGS) for specific SPNs (e.g., CIFS, MSSQLSvc).

Lateral Movement from RDP Hosts:

Once an attacker gets into one RDP-connected host, they can pivot laterally, dump tickets from other logged-in sessions, and eventually reach a domain controller.

Golden vs Silver Ticket Recap:
Golden Ticket: Forged TGT created using the KRBTGT hash; gives long-term, undetectable domain-wide access.

Silver Ticket: Forged TGS using service account hash; lets attackers access services without contacting the KDC.

Mitigations to Recommend:
Use Windows Defender Credential Guard

Prevents LSASS from exposing credential material to userland (protects against Mimikatz-style dumps).

Avoid RDP as DA or High Privilege Accounts

Implement tiered admin access — no direct DA logins via RDP from workstations.

Enable Restricted Admin Mode for RDP

Stops creds from being stored in memory on the target machine.

Enable LSA Protection

Protects LSASS from being accessed by unsigned processes.

Log and Monitor Ticket Use

Track unusual TGT/TGS lifetimes, odd service requests, and event logs 4768–4771.

Shorten Ticket Lifetimes

Limits the window for replay of stolen tickets.

Segment and Monitor RDP Hosts Closely

Use jump servers with EDR, limited network access, and full logging.

In short: yes, RDP makes your client significantly more vulnerable to ticket attacks unless strict defenses are in place.

Do you want a checklist-style remediation sheet for your client to harden against ticket-based attacks?

Any other ad based attacks are possible while having RDP in use? 
ChatGPT said:
Yes — Active Directory (AD)-based attacks increase substantially when RDP is part of a remote access strategy, especially in hybrid or loosely secured environments. RDP can give attackers the foothold they need to launch a variety of AD-centric attacks.

Here’s a breakdown of key AD attacks that become more feasible when RDP is in use:

1. Credential Dumping & Pass-the- Attacks*
Pass-the-Hash (PtH): If a user logs in with NTLM (e.g., over RDP without Kerberos), hashes can be extracted and reused.

Pass-the-Ticket (PtT): Using stolen Kerberos tickets (TGT or TGS), attackers can impersonate users or access services.

Over-Pass-the-Hash: Combines NTLM hash to request Kerberos TGT from KDC (via TGT request).

RDP Impact: RDP sessions often leave credentials and tokens in memory; attackers on the box can extract and reuse them.

2. Kerberoasting
AD allows users to request service tickets (TGS) for SPNs.

Attackers on an RDP host can dump these TGS tickets and brute-force offline for plaintext passwords of service accounts (often high-priv).

RDP Impact: Once inside via RDP, attackers can request TGS tickets for any SPN account without needing special rights.

3. DCSync & DCShadow
DCSync: Mimics a domain controller to replicate user password hashes.

DCShadow: Injects malicious changes into AD replication.

RDP Impact: If attackers RDP into a box where a Domain Admin has logged in, they can extract creds/hashes and perform these attacks.

4. Group Policy Abuse (GPP, GPO Hijacking)
Misconfigured GPOs can leak passwords (e.g., in SYSVOL).

Attackers can hijack or modify GPOs for persistence or privilege escalation.

RDP Impact: Local or RDP-authenticated users might have permissions to modify GPOs or access unprotected SYSVOL shares.

5. SIDHistory & Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)
SIDHistory Abuse: Inject old SIDs into tokens to gain elevated access.

RBCD Attack: Attackers configure delegation to impersonate high-priv users.

RDP Impact: From inside, attackers can create machine accounts and configure delegation paths.

6. Enumeration & Reconnaissance
BloodHound: Attackers can run tools from an RDP session to map AD privilege relationships.

LDAP Queries: Extract user, group, and trust info.

RDP Impact: Once inside, AD is noisy and open to legitimate users — attackers can blend in while enumerating.

7. Token Manipulation & Session Hijacking
Token Impersonation: Steal or impersonate tokens from active sessions.

Session Hijack: RDP sessions can be hijacked if improperly disconnected or left open.

Recommendations to Counter AD Attacks via RDP:
Use LAPS or gMSA: Avoid static local admin creds.

Restrict AD Tool Access (e.g., PowerShell, RSAT) on RDP hosts.

Tiered Admin Model: Never let Tier 0 (DA) accounts log in to Tier 1/2 systems.

Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) Privileged Access.

Enable Logging:

4662 (AD object access), 4624 (logins), 4768–4776 (Kerberos), 5136 (directory service changes)

Use EDR/HIPS on RDP hosts.

Limit RDP logins to jump servers or hardened terminals only.

TL;DR: RDP is a vector, not just a tool — once attackers are on an RDP box, the full AD attack tree is available to them unless the environment is hardened and segmented.
