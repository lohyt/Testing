1. Purpose
----------
To establish a standardized procedure for conducting forensic analysis during cybersecurity incidents, in alignment with ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.16 (Information Security Incident Management) and NIST SP 800-61, ensuring evidence integrity, legal admissibility, and root cause identification.

2. Scope
--------
This procedure applies to all IT systems, employees, and third parties involved in a security incident requiring forensic investigation.

3. Roles and Responsibilities
-----------------------------
| Role                   | Responsibilities                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Response Lead | Coordinate forensic tasks, maintain chain of custody, report findings       |
| IT Security Analyst    | Perform forensic collection, analysis, and documentation                    |
| Legal/Compliance       | Advise on legal implications, evidence handling, and retention requirements |
| System Owner           | Provide access, context, and support during investigation                   |

4. Forensic Analysis Procedure
------------------------------

4.1 Preparation
- Ensure forensic tools and personnel are in place and trained.
- Maintain a current asset inventory and data flow diagrams.
- Define criteria for when forensic investigations are initiated.

4.2 Identification
- Confirm incident through logs, alerts, or user reports.
- Document the nature, scope, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Notify appropriate stakeholders.

4.3 Containment
- Short-Term: Isolate affected systems to prevent spread while preserving volatile data.
- Long-Term: Implement network segmentation and monitoring to support ongoing analysis.

4.4 Evidence Collection
- Use industry-standard tools to acquire:
  - Memory dumps, disk images, network traffic, system and application logs.
- Label and hash each artifact (e.g., MD5/SHA256) to ensure integrity.
- Secure all evidence in tamper-proof, access-controlled storage.

4.5 Chain of Custody
- Assign a unique evidence ID to each collected item.
- Document the who, what, when, where, why, and how of evidence handling:
  - Who collected or accessed the evidence
  - What the evidence is (description)
  - When it was handled (date/time)
  - Where it was stored/transferred
  - Why it was accessed
  - How it was collected and protected
- Ensure each handoff is signed and time-stamped by both parties.
- Store completed chain of custody records securely, with restricted access.

4.6 Analysis
- Reconstruct attack timeline using collected evidence.
- Identify root cause, entry point, malware, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
- Use threat intelligence to correlate findings with known threat actors or campaigns.
- Ensure all actions taken are logged, reproducible, and defensible.

4.7 Reporting
- Prepare a formal forensic investigation report, including:
  - Incident summary
  - Evidence collected and analysis steps
  - Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
  - Root cause and affected assets
  - Mitigation and recovery actions
- Retain both the forensic report and chain of custody logs in secure storage.
- Provide a redacted or summarized version to management and external parties, if required.

4.8 Post-Incident Activities
- Retain evidence and reports per regulatory and legal requirements.
- Conduct a lessons-learned session with involved stakeholders.
- Update detection, prevention, and response controls based on findings.
- Revise policies and procedures as necessary.

5. Tools and Resources
----------------------
- Forensic Tools: FTK Imager, EnCase, Volatility, Autopsy, Wireshark, Log2Timeline
- Log Sources: SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK), system logs, firewall and proxy logs
- Chain of Custody Forms: Maintained in incident management platform or secure document store

7. Review and Maintenance
-------------------------
This procedure must be reviewed annually or after significant incidents to ensure it reflects current best practices, legal standards, and organizational needs.
