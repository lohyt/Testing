# Vulnerability Report

## Summary
Default hidden shares on Windows servers were found to be accessible, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive information and system compromise.

## Impact
1. **Sensitive Information Exposure**: Access to hidden shares allowed the reading of sensitive files such as password hashes.
2. **Remote Code Execution**: Malicious files could be uploaded and executed on the target system.
3. **System Disruption**: System files could be modified, leading to potential service disruptions.

## Recommendations
1. **Disable Unnecessary Shares**: Disable all default hidden shares that are not required.
2. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to administrative shares to only authorized users and systems.
3. **Monitor Access**: Implement monitoring and alerting for access to sensitive shares.

## Proof of Concept
- Accessed `C$` share using `net use`.
- Read `SAM` file containing password hashes.
- Uploaded and executed a malicious file in the `Temp` directory.
